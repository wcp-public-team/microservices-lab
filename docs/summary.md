Congratulations, you've built a microservice application in IBM Cloud!  

In the short time you've been working on this lab you've done a lot:

* created an account on IBM Cloud
* created an application using a starter kit
* added a resource (Cloudant database) to your app (although we didn't actually use it in the code today, stay tuned.  In the future this lab will be updated with an optional section that does!)
* deployed the app to IBM Cloud Cloud Foundry
* used the Web IDE in the toolchain to add logic to the application to create a REST API
* committed and pushed the code to the git repo, which triggered the toolchain to automatically build and redeploy the app with the code changes.
* updated the swagger definition so that your new API operations can be tested using the API Explorer

__Whew, you did a lot!  Thanks for attending today!__
